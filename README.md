<h1>Password Generator</h1>

I've been assigned to code a working password generator potentially incorporating numbers, special characters, and both uppercase and lowercase letters, with varying lengths. This task was primarily accomplished through Javascript. The code written is clean and as concise as possible. I'd had a rough draft written that was completely scrapped due to being far too convoluted, and through concerted effort was pared down to what's presented in this repository.

Included here is a youtube link showcasing my password generator in action.
